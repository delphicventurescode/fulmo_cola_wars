## 🌟 About This Repo  

This repository exists to capture a **Gxoja Momento** — a moment of pure joy.  
It commemorates a special exchange inspired by **Prof. Vijay Govindarajan’s** tribute to **Indra Nooyi** on LinkedIn, and the incredible ripple effects of **La Gxoja Projekto**.  

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists  

- To celebrate the **spirit of joy-driven leadership**.  
- To document the **birth and spread** of *La Gxoja Projekto*, which began as a South Indian happiness initiative in January 2025 and is now resonating globally.  
- To mark the surreal milestones:  
  - The launch of the **Fulmo Talk Series**, featuring **Prof. Sonja Lyubomirsky**.  
  - The exciting response from **Mr. Errol Musk** about joining the series.  

This repo is simply a **snapshot in time** — a digital keepsake of joy, connection, and momentum.
